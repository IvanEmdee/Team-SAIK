## Game Description

- What makes our game unique is combining real time combat with deck building.
- The game will be on PC using keyboard inputs.
- For our audience we hope to combine those who like the strategy of Deck Builders with the fast paced style of real time dungeon crawlers.
- For out visual style we wanted to go with something bright since in our previous games we have all done dark and gloomy.
- For our MVP game loop we are aiming to have a basic room with enemies that we can kill with a card
